# DeepLearning
This contains different scripts I've tried in Deep Learning

This repository shall contain the different programs that i will have tried over time:

𝟏. 𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚_𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥.𝐩𝐲: MLP on IRIS dataset,Z-score Normalisation, 10 fold cross validation, 1 Hot encoding, 3 layer MLP with sigmoid at hidden layer and softmax at output. Weight initialisation for each fold is done 10 times. And since 10 fold cross validation in itself is repeated 100 times, that makes it 1000 times. No regulirasation is done. Finally the model is compiled, tested and trained with 1000 epochs with each weight initialisation. All the output accuracies are written in a file.
  
𝟐. 𝟑𝐝𝟐.𝐩𝐲: A simple python 3 program for plotting points in 3D, which shall be used in later projects too.
